# **Buy-Me**

**Buy-me** is an app that helps the user keep track of there regular shopping, with multiple editing choices - quantity, location, deleting an item as well as adding new items and checking if the grocery needs to be bought or not. It's an app designed to work both for the single person as well as being interactive enough to be used for the weekley shopping to a household, club, for event planning etc, without having to always do the shopping togetherbbut still being able to easily keep track of what is needed and what is all ready in store. 

Let me introduce you further to [**Buy-Me**](https://but-me-py.herokuapp.com/)!

## **Design**

## **Data structure**
To get a clear view of what should be included and how the flow of the program should work, I used [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) to construct a data model mockup as well as a mockup of the worksheet.

<img src="assets/image/flowchart.png" width=1200> <img src="assets/image/list-mockup.png" width=500> 
<br>

### **Table layout**
Buy-Me is displayed in a python terminal supplied by [**Heroku**](https://www.heroku.com/), giving the app a simple yet straigtforward look.<br>
To make the lists easy to read and more visual appealing, [**PrettyTable**](https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/) was installed and implemented when the lists are diplayed to the user.

## **Features**

### **Welcome page**

After the user runs the application they are greeted with a welcome message that in a few lines describes the app and gives the user the option to choose between three diffrent list settings. Along the way, the user always get the choice to confirm their action or revert their choice.

<br>

<br>
<br>

### **Complete list**
<details>
The complete list is a none editable list consisting of the standard list and the extra list merged together so the user has a comprehensive list off all the items in one view. The list can be sorted regarding the location in the store or if the item is checked as 'to buy' or not. After choosing to sort the list or not, the user get's the choice to other quit the app or go back to the main menu a.k.a. the welcome page.
<br>
<br>
<strong>The list sorted on location, by default.</strong>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/complete.png" width=1200> 
<br>
<br>
<strong>The list sorted by the need to buy or not.</strong>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/complete-sorted.png" width=1200>
<br>
</details>


### **Standard list**
<details>
The second list is the standard list. Set to be the regular list for everyday/ weekly shopping groceries that the user restocks every week. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>The list sorted on index number.</strong>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/standard.png" width=1200> 
<br>
</details>


### **Extra list**
<details>
The third list is the extra list. The purpose of this list is to fill it with items and groceries the user not need every week, or if there is something special the user likes to buy the next time they go to the store. 
<br>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/extra.png" width=1200>
<br>
</details>

### **Actions menu**
<details>
After the user have picked either the standard or extra list, they get the option to edit the list or not. If they press no, they go back to the main menu and if they chose to edit the list, they are presented with an actions menu. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Their is 6 actions for the user to pick from.</strong>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/actions.png" width=1200> 
<br>
<br>
</details>

### **Check item**
<details>
The first option on the list is to check the item if it needs to be bought('yes') or if it has been bought already, or is in stock at home ('no'). The user gets the choice to either change the buy status of all the items on the list to either YES or NO or just one item. After the item(s) are checked, the user are displayed the updated list.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Check all items.</strong>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/check-all.png" width=1200> 
<br>
<br>
<strong>After all items been checked, the user automatically gets transported back to the main menu.</strong>
<br>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/check-after.png" width=1200>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Check one item.</strong>
<br>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/check-item.png" width=1200>
<br>
<br>
<strong>After the first item is checked, the user get's the choice to check another item straight away or go back to the main menu.</strong>
<br>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/check-item-after.png" width=1200>
<br>
</details>

### **Change quantity**
<details>
The second option on the list is to change the quantity of an item. First the user picks the item to they want to update, and then they can input the new quantity number. Before the item is updated, they user has to confirm their action. After the item are edited, the user are displayed the updated list and get's the choice to edit the quantity of another item or go back to the main menu.
<br>
<br>
<strong>First the user choose an item.</strong>
<br>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/quantity.png" width=1200>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Then the uses gets to input the new quantity before confirming the choice.</strong>
<br>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/quantity-after.png" width=1200>
<br>
</details>

### **Change location**
<details>
The third option on the list is to change the location of an item. The flow of the actions are similar to the choice of changing the quantity. After the item is edited, the user are displayed the updated list and get's the choice to edit the location of another item or go back to the main menu.
<br>
<br>
<strong>First the user choose an item.</strong>
<br>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/location.png" width=1200>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Then the uses gets to input the new location before confirming the choice. The user is displayed examples of diffrent locations in the store. </strong>
<br>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/location-after.png" width=1200>
<br>
</details>


### **Add item**
<details>
The fourth option on the list is to add a new item. After chosing to add an item and confirming the choice, the user gets three new values to choose before they can update the list; <em>Name</em> of item, <em>quantity</em> and <em>location</em> in the store. The item is autimatically set to buy: <em>Yes</em>. After the item is edited, the user are displayed the updated list and get's the choice to add another item or go back to the main menu.
<br>
<br>
<strong>The user get's three input fields to fill out.</strong>
<br>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/add.png" width=1200>
<br>
<br>
<strong>After the user confirms the choice to add the input's given, the new updated list is displayed. </strong>
<br>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/add-after.png" width=1200>
<br>
</details>

### **Delete item**
<details>
The fifth edit option on the list is to delete an item. After chosing the item to delete, the user are shown the complete row of content and needs to confirming the choice before it is deleted. The row indew is automatically updated after the row is deketed, to display the current order of items. After the item is edited, the user are displayed the updated list and get's the choice to delete another item or go back to the main menu.
<br>
<br>
<strong>The user needs to confirm the displayed row as the correct one they want to delete.</strong>
<br>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/delete.png" width=1200>
<br>
<br>
<strong>After the user confirms the choice to add the input's given, the new updated list is displayed. </strong>
<br>
<br>
<img src="assets/image/delete-after.png" width=1200>
<br>
</details>

### **Back to main menu**
<details>
The last and sixth option on the list is not to edit an item but to go back to the main menu. It might be that the user chose the wrong list or that the item they wanted to edit all ready is edited or a number of reasons why the user would like to see another list.
<br>
<br>
<strong>The user get's the choice to go back.</strong>
<img src="assets/image/back.png" width=1200>
<br>
</details>

### **Future features**
- I would love to add a feauture so the user is able to sort the groceries accoring to the location they appear in their store, making the shopping even easier and with better flow for the user.
- Ideally I would also like to add style to the application to make more estetically pleasing.

## **Technologies**

### **Languages**

- **Python**
<br>
Is the primary language used to develop the CLI (*command line interface*) application.

- **Other languages**
<br>
The template provided by Code Institute for this project also includes HTML, CSS and Javascript. Though I have not used this languages on my own development in this project, they provides a foundation for my project to be built and deployed correctly.

### **Tools**

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
    -  I used Heroku to deploy the application.  

- [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/)
    - I used Lucid Chart to design the data model and list mockup for the project.

- [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
    - I used GitPod as the code editor as well as to display to test out changes in my code.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - I used GitHub to create a repository for my project.

- [Google-auth](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
    - I used Google-auth to authenticate the Google API's so the project could be accessed in the cloud.

- [Google cloud platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
    - I used to create the API's that connects the application to the spreadsheet at Google Sheet.

- [Google sheets](https://spreadsheets.google.com)
    - I used for storing data accessed by the application.

- [Gspread](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/)
    - I used gspread to handle and update the data stored in the spreadsheet at Google Sheet.

## **Deployment**

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.


The project was deployed to **GitHub** from **GitPod**:
- Go to the project's repository page at GitHub.
- Go to *settings* in the upper menu, and then choose *pages* in the left-hand menu.
- Under the Source section, select the *Main branch* from the drop-down menu and click *save*.
- On top of the screen there will be a massage displayed with the live link.
<br>


The live link can be found here: https://monika-81.github.io/project2/
<br>

A copy of this GitHub Repository can be made by either making a copy on your local machine or by forking the GitHub content. By using a copy of the repository changes can be made to the copy without affecting the original code. To make a copy of the repository, follow these steps:

**Clone**
- Locate the repository at **GitHub**.
- At the top of the file's menu, click the green *code* button to the right.
- The first option in the drop-down menu is clone, where you get three choices of how to clone the repository.
- To clone a copy to your GitHub Desktop, click **Open with GitHub Desktop**.
- By clicking "choose" you can pick where you want to store the clone on you local machine.
- And finally, click the button *clone*.
<br>

**Forking**
- Locate the repository at **GitHub**.
- At the top right-hand side is a button called *fork*, click on the button to create a copy of the original repository in your GitHub Account.

## **Credits**

### **Content**

For most of the development and bug fixes I went back to the Code Institute LMS and the learning material for the python module and the 'Love Sandwiches' project. I also turned to the Slack community and the search function, where I found many tips when I got stuck. When I didn't find the answers to understand what I needed to change there, I consulted external sources while searching for the answer using Google. No piece of code was copied to use in the project, by reading on many diffrent sites I learned more about python and used what I learned to try out was doing wrong.

Some of the sites I frequently **consulted** was :
<br>

* [CodeGrepper](https://www.codegrepper.com/)
* [DelftStack](https://www.delftstack.com/)
* [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/)
* [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)  
* [PythonGuides](https://pythonguides.com/)
* [RealPython](https://realpython.com/)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) 
* [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/)
